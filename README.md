All the banks, Insurance Company are trying to figure out effective business strategies to persuade customers to apply their loans.

Machine learning algorithms have a pretty good performance on this purpose, which are widely-used by the banking. Here, Our team will work on loan behaviours prediction using machine learning models.

It is an interative notebook that drives from pre-processing the data till applying ML models.
